1. create apps
    $ python manage.py startapp lin_app

2. Open the lin_app/views.py and put the following Python code in it:

        from django.http import HttpResponse

        def index(request):
            return HttpResponse("Selamat datang!")

3. This is the simplest view possible in Django. 
    To call the view, we need to map it to a URL, and for this we need a URLconf.
    To create a URLconf in the polls directory, create a file called urls.py.
    In the lin_app/urls.py file include the following code:

        from django.urls import path

        from . import views

        urlpatterns = [
            path('', views.index, name='index'),
        ]

4. The next step is to point the root URLconf at the polls.urls module. 
    In lin_django/urls.py, add an import for django.urls.include and insert an include() 
    in the urlpatterns list, so you have:

        from django.contrib import admin
        from django.urls import include, path

        urlpatterns = [
            path('lin_app/', include('lin_app.urls')),
            path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        ]

5. run server!
    $ python manage.py runserver

    try to open localhost:8000/admin & localhost:8000/lin_app
